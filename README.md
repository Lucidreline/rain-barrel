### ‚òë Tasks

- [x] Refactor some files that have functions into a utils folder or something similar
- [x] Create a routes folder where you will have the route to grab our data through json
- [ ] Decide how you will delete old data to prevent the database from getting too big (delete after 1 year? etc.)
- [x] Write up this README.md (show how to set this app up with config/default.json, etc.)
- [x] When grabbing data, use a few different APIs and average out the data from all APIs to get an average temperature
